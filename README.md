# CTIS255--Project
It is an HTML project that simulated a cryptocurrency marketplace using real historical data from 2021. Key features included interactive candlestick charts, real-time wallet management, and a trading interface allowing users to buy and sell digital assets. The simulation progressed day-by-day, culminating in a final evaluation of the user's portfolio value by the end of the year.
